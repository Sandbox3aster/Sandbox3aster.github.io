### Brief Biography

I'm a first year Ph.D Student in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, my advisor is [Prof. Zhangyang Wang](http://www.atlaswang.com/). From 2016 to 2017, I was a research assistant at [Visual Computing Lab](http://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), ShanghaiTech University, under the supervision of [Prof. Shenghua Gao](http://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/gaoshh/). I received my B.Eng degree in Electrical Engineering from Tongji University, Shanghai in 2016. I was a exchange student at Technische Universität Darmstadt in 2014.

### Research Interests

My research interests lie in deep learning and computer vision, specifically in compression of CNN to enable deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.

I also work on high-level vision task such as saliency detection, low-level vision task such as image denoising, dehazing, deblurring, super-resolution, low quality image restoration in general.
